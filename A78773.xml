         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Mountiners, togeather with divers others of the ragged regiment, acounted and eſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of us, the ſcume of the Northern Counties, they were alſo accompanied with the Lord <hi>Rivers,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Briſtoll;</hi> and came towards the City of Cheſter, in a Warlike manner, with about 1300. Horſe and foote, but they found there as Noble and undaunted ſpirits as they have done in other places.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:123921:4"/>
            <p>For at their firſt approach neere unto the City, the Earle of <hi>Lindſey</hi> rod foremoſt upon a faire and comely Steed, which made ſome of the Inhabitants of the City of <hi>Cheſter</hi> thirſt after him, to bring him a little lower, and indeed happily might it have beene ſo, had he not retreated ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, for no ſooner had he given the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet upon the Towne, but he fell backe, then the Earle <hi>Rivers,</hi> with his Venomous ſpleen and envy brought up his foote, thinking to have beought his Divilliſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to perfection, and to have fired the Towne with wild-fire, but by Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and helping hand, all their hopes were fouſtrated, and their devices and Plots could take no effect, for their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe was as bad as their cauſes, and well worſe, theſe Commiſſioners of <hi>Array</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving performed what they could and ſound all was but labour in vaine, they about 2. of the cloke in the afternoon, with drew their forces from <hi>Cheſter</hi> and march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
